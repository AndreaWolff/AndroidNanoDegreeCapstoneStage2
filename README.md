# AndroidNanoDegreeCapstoneStage2

<b>Project Overview</b>
<p>In Stage 1, we designed and planned a Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!</p>

<b>Why this Project?</b>
<p>In this project, I demonstrated the skills I learned in this Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app 
experience of my own. By the end of this project, I will have an app that I can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.</p>

<b>What Will I Learn?</b>
<p>The Capstone project gave me the experience of the full development cycle of an app.</p>

# Let There Be Life

<b>Description</b>
<p>Let There Be Life was created for all your plant growing needs. Let There Be Life will assist you with keeping track of what plants 
you have growing and information about each plant. Let There Be Life is also a great app for an upcoming hydroponic plant growing 
enthusiast who needs to keep track of the plants they have planted.</p>

<b>Features</b>
<p>List the main features or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Let There Be Life app:
<ul>
  <li>Displays a list of Plants</li>
  <li>Saves new Plants</li>
  <li>Displays selected Plant details including:
    <ul>
      <li>Plant name</li>
      <li>Plant seed date</li>
      <li>Plant description</li>
      <li>Plant image (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allows the user to share Plant Details</li>
  <li>Queries online web service to retrieve Plant information (if the Plant name is on the server)</li>
  <li>Homescreen Widget displays your Plants</li>
  <li>Firebase Crashlytics to ensure quality, crash-free performance for the user</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>What the Let There Be Life app does:</b>
<p>Let There Be Life is backed by a Firebase Real-Time Database. This allows the user to create and save a plant to the database to be access
on any device the user uses. Further functionality (to be developed in the future) will allow users to sign into their own individual 
accounts and view their plants. For the time being there is currently just one user for this application.</p>

<p>This app has also been fitted with Firebase Crashlytics. This helps the developer deal with Real-Time user crashes and provides
the developer with fast feedback on crashes that may occur, leading to a better user experience.</p>

<p>Let There Be Life is also backed with a Room Database, which hold the top 40 common plants a plant euthusiast may grow. This allows the
user to view more information if the plant is found in this database. If unfortunately the plant is not found in this database, it will not 
affect the apps functionality and the user will still have a great user experience!</p>

Note: Due to time restriction I was unable to complete Task 16 or 17 (which were marked as optional on the Capstone document). These updates
will be implemented in further development.
